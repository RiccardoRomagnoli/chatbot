Input sentence: My code generates this error:

TypeError: wrapper() takes exactly 1 argument (2 given)
I know I'm creating the api instance correctly as I'm using it to successfully call the linode_ip_list method prior to calling the disk list method.

Just to see what happens, if I don't provide the linode_id argument, I get this error:

linode.api.MissingRequiredArgument: 'LinodeID'
If I call the method with a linode ID, the error says I'm giving it two arguments. But if I don't give it any arguments, it says I'm missing an argument. At this point, I'm not sure if the LinodeID should be an integer or a string but I get the same error in either case. How do I call this method so that I don't get the TypeError argument?
