3,Can you recommend what Python library to use for accessing AMQP (RabbitMQ)? From my research pika seems to be the preferred one.,"Pika is the RabbitMQ recommended library, you might also want to look at Celery ",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5031606/good-python-library-for-amqp,1
3,I just discovered that celery creates a queue per task which is a disappointing weakness,We haven't found that to be an issue; our usage tasks get consumed quickly. I'd be interested to know if it's causing you difficulties though.,,
3,Never tried celery because it just didn't seem to fit with the overall AMQP architecture. Message queueuing is not just for distributing tasks to pools of workers.,"Ok, good to know. Yeah.. the main plus for celery was that it took a lot of coding away. If we find problems we may end up writing a thin wrapper around pika, as you have done. Good luck with your project! ",,
