"TypeError: '<=' not supported between instances of 'list' and 'int' Why is it not supported?
Or did I miss something?"
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'list' and 'int'. How can I fix this?

"I am new to python and have hit a wall. I followed several tutorials but cant get past the error:
    p = Pump.getPumps()
TypeError: getPumps() missing 1 required positional argument: 'self'
I examined several tutorials but there doesn't seem to be anything different from my code.

"I understand that it wants self to be passed into database but cannot understand where I am going to get this from as self from my main.py contains the wrong context.
I have my main class in which I want to call the database class and execute a function from withinclass
 Main:
    def __init__(self):
        self.db = Database
        self.db.createConnection()
 When I run this, I am presented with the following error.
TypeError: createConnection() missing 1 required positional argument: 'self' "
