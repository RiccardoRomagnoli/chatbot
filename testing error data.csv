Before this error it had already given me another one that said ""xrange does not exist"" or something like that, so I looked it up and just changed xrange to range in the nx_shp.py file, which seemed to solve it.

From what I've read it could be related to the Python version (Python2 vs Python3)."

"Hello, i'm trying to control mobile robot 'rb1 base', it has elevate function which can move its head up and down. You can see the Service caller in the down side of the picture, it has the service topic named '/rb1_base/robotnik_base_control/set_elevator', based on that information, i wrote the service call program, you can see this top of the picture. In the SetElevator.h there is only one variable named 'int32 action', if i make the action variable to 1 then the robot elevate up, if i make it to -1 then the robot elevate down. so i wrote the code 'srv(1)' to elevate up the robot. But it says 'AttributeError : 'int' object has no attribute 'action''. Is there special way to change the variable 'int32 action'? Is it not just int?
