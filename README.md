This is the project for course EECE 634 - Natural Language Processing

Python is one of the dominant programming languages today. People in industry and research are heading towards using this language, primarily after the rise of the machine learning libraries and software development toolkits. Most programmers use Google Search for searching specific Python-related questions in their course of coding. Our project is a Chatbot, trained on a dataset manually collected from Stack Overflow, which is one of the leading programming Question-Answering (QA) platforms online. The dataset contains around 230 manually collected questions and answers ranging over 7 categories including: Greetings, Library related questions, Errors, Syntax, Code Interpretation, Methods, and Directories.
